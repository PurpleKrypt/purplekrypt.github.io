					<h1> Terms and Conditions </h1>
				
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<t><b>Effective Date: 14/2/2026</b><t/>
						<t>
						By downloading, installing, or using the PurpleKrypt Graphical Tool (the "Tool," the "Software," or "PurpleKrypt"), you agree to comply
						with and be bound by the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these terms, do not use the Tool.
						<t/>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>1. License</h5>
						<t>
						The PurpleKrypt Graphical Tool is an open-source Software released under the GNU
						General Public License (GPL) v3.0. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the Tool in accordance with
						the terms of the GPLv3 license.
						<t/>
						<t>
						For more details on the terms of the GPLv3 license, visit <a href=""><l>GNU General Public License v3.0.</l></a>
						<t/>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>2. Software Description</h5>
						<t>
							PurpleKrypt Graphical Tool is an open-source encryption application designed to securely encrypt 
							and decrypt both files and text. The Software supports key generation derived from a user-defined password, a key file, or a combination of both.
						</t>
						<t>
							Key material derived from passwords is generated using the Argon2id key derivation function provided by 
							the Bouncy Castle cryptographic library. Encryption and decryption operations are performed using the AES-256-GCM algorithm,
							as implemented by the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE).
						</t>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>3. No Data Collection</h5>
						<t>
						PurpleKrypt Graphical Tool does not collect any data. The Software operates locally
						on your device, and no personal information, usage data, or other data is transmitted to external servers
						or third parties.
						<t/>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>4. No Warranty / "As-Is" Basis</h5>
						<t>
						The Tool is provided on an "as-is" basis, with no warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but
						not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The
						developers and contributors to the Tool make no claims regarding the Tool’s performance, security, or
						suitability for any particular use case.
						<t/>
						<t>
						You agree to use the Tool at your own risk. The developers and contributors shall not be held liable for
						any damages, including but not limited to loss of data, system malfunctions, or any indirect, incidental,
						or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the Tool
						<t/>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>5. No Modification of Data</h5>
						<t>
						The Tool does not automatically alter or modify any original input data. By default, it operates by creating an encrypted or decrypted copy of the input data.
						</t>
						<t>
						The user is provided with an optional setting to remove the original input data after the copy has been successfully created. If enabled, this option should be
						used with caution and does not guarantee secure, irreversible, or unrecoverable data removal from the storage device.
						</t>
						<t>
						The developers and contributors of the Tool shall not be held responsible or liable for any data corruption, data loss, or any data that may remain recoverable
						after deletion.
						</t>
						<t>
						You are solely responsible for verifying and maintaining the integrity of the original data both before and after any encryption or decryption operation.
						</t>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>6. Keyfile and Password Safekeeping</h5>
						<t>
						The Tool may generate encrypted or unencrypted key files containing cryptographic keys that are essential for encrypting and decrypting data. You are solely
						responsible for securely storing and backing up these key files.
						</t>
						<t>
						If a key file is lost, corrupted, or otherwise rendered unusable, the associated data cannot be decrypted. The Tool may not automatically detect whether a key
						file is encrypted; therefore, it is your responsibility to know which key files are encrypted and to remember the password used to protect them.
						</t>
						<t>
						For data encrypted using a key derived solely from a password, you are responsible for remembering the password used for encryption, as it will be required
						to decrypt the data.						
						</t>
						<t>
						The developers and contributors shall not be held responsible or liable for the loss, corruption, theft, or misuse of key files or passwords.
						</t>
						<t>
						You are strongly advised to maintain multiple secure backups of all key files and to store passwords securely in reliable and protected locations.
						</t>
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>7. PK AAD ID Safekeeping</h5>
						<t>
						The Tool generates a file named "pk_aad_id" the first time the Software is run. This file contains a randomly
						generated identifier that may be used as Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) during file encryption. By default, this
						feature is disabled; however, the user may choose to enable it.
						</t>
						<t>
						When the "PK AAD ID" is used, any data encrypted using the "pk_aad_id" as Additional Authenticated
						Data (AAD) cannot be decrypted on another or the same installation or copy of the Software without access to the same
						"pk_aad_id" file, even if the correct key file and/or password are provided.
						</t>
						<t>
						If the "pk_aad_id" file or the associated Software instance is lost, corrupted, or otherwise rendered
						unusable, the encrypted data cannot be decrypted. You are solely responsible for maintaining and safeguarding the
						"pk_aad_id" file.
						</t>
						<t>
						The developers and contributors shall not be held responsible or liable for the loss, corruption, theft, or misuse of
						the "pk_aad_id" file or any data associated with it.
						</t>
						<t>
						You are strongly advised to maintain multiple secure backups of the "pk_aad_id" file and any associated
						Software installations in reliable and protected locations.
						</t>
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>8. Limitation of Liability</h5>
						<t>
						To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the developers or contributors of the Tool be liable
						for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with
						the use or inability to use the Tool. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of data, data corruption, loss of
						encryption keys, loss of key files, loss of passwords, loss of Additional Authenticated Data (PK_AAD_ID), or any other
						damages, even if the developers or contributors have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
						</t>
						<t>
						The Tool is provided with the understanding that its use involves inherent risks. Any damage, loss, or adverse outcome
						resulting from the use, misuse, or incorrect operation of the Software is solely the responsibility of the user.
						</t>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>9. Modification and Distribution</h5>
						<t>
						You may use, modify, and distribute the Software in accordance with the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3).
						However, if you redistribute the Tool or any modified version of it, you must:
						<t/>
						<t>
						• Provide proper credit and acknowledgment to the original developers and contributors.
						<t/>
						<t>
						• Include a copy of, or a link to, this Terms and Conditions document.
						<t/>
						<t>
						• Ensure that the applicable license terms are respected and that users are informed that the Software is released under the GPLv3.
						<t/>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>10. Indemnification</h5>
						<t>
						You agree to indemnify and hold the developers, contributors, and affiliated entities harmless from any 
						claims, losses, damages, or legal expenses arising from your use or misuse of the Tool. This includes 
						any third-party claims resulting from your actions or inactions.
						<t/>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>11. Changes to Terms</h5>
						<t>
						We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Any changes will be posted on the official 
						website or distribution platform, and the updated Terms will be effective upon posting. It is your responsibility 
						to review these Terms periodically to stay informed of any changes.
						<t/>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
						<h5>12. Governing Law</h5>
						<t>
						These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws applicable in the 
						user's jurisdiction, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
						<t/>
						
					</div>
					</br></br>
					
					<div class="restricted_width_box" >
